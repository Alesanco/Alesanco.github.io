# alesanco.github.io

Simply my personal page, just a little bit different from others: you have to compile and run it.

I've used some stuff such as Base64 decoding, an esoteric language, ASCII art, hex dump, obfuscation and so on...

Why? Because in programming there must be fantasy, fun, genius and recklessness.
