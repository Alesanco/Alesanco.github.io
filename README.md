# alesanco.github.io

Simply my personal page, just a little bit different from others: you have to compile and run it.

I used some stuff such as Base64 decoding, an esoteric language, ASCII art, hex dump, obfuscation and so on...

Why? Because in programming there must be immagination, fun, genius and recklessness.
